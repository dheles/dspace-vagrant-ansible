# dspace-vagrant-ansible
Project to install, configure, and manage DSpace using Ansible and Vagrant.

Forked from [dsapce-vagrant](https://github.com/dheles/dspace-vagrant) (which I'm keeping around for now, for anyone who wants to use Vagrant to setup DSpace, but doesn't want to (or can't) use Ansible).

## note:
this is very much a work-in-progress and under active development
