# NOTE: while it would be easier to synchronize files directly from one server to  another,
# it appears that this would require installing a private key on one of them.
# so instead, i go through the trouble of bringing the desired file to the control,
# then pushing it to the desired destination(s)

# NOTE: can't seem to get synchronize module to keep the file ownership as advertised
# therefore, using copy when moving to destination, as this allows resetting ownership
